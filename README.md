### Hi there, I'm Peter

- I'm an Environmental Data Scientist interested in long-term monitoring, sampling and statistical modeling.
- My current research focuses on statistical approaches for optimizing long-term groundwater monitoring networks.
- I'm also interested in geospatial and environmental data analysis, climate change, hydrology and hydrogeology.

### I'm currently working on:

- Sampling Long-Term Groundwater Monitoring Networks Using Spatially Balanced Designs with Proportional Inclusion Probabilities
- Using PyTorch framework for machine learning models
- R | Python | TeX
